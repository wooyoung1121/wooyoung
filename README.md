### Branch dad

`git` allows for parallel development by multiple developers on a single repository using `branch`
 I created a branch named `dad`
 
 You can switch to `dad` branch by
 ```bash
 git checkout -b dad origin/dad
 ```
 Above command will checkout `dad` branch from github, name it `dad` in your local directory.
